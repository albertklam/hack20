      <h1> Image Mask Detection</h1>
      <p>
      Wearing a mask is a deemed as a way to slow the spread of virus amid the
      Covid-19 pandemic. Our team trained a model that should detect whether
      the person in the image has face mask on or off. The model can be used
      in various ways:
      <ol>
        <li> For grocery store where face masks are required for entry. </li>
        <li> To detect if the person at the door is wearing a mask before you
          open the door.</li>

      </ol>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>To demonstrate our model</h2>
      Here you can upload a photo used for detection. While this may be a
      trivial application for our model, it serves the purpose of demonstrating
      the accuracy.
